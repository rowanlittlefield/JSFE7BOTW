# Emblem of Fire

### Background
This project is a browser game modeled after the 6th and 7th entries in Nintendo's popular Fire Emblem series. The gameplay features turn-based strategy against an AI player in which the the player moves his/her units across a map to fight units on the opposing team and acheive victory by capturing the opposing team's throne. 

### Functionality & MVP

This project intends to emulate the core mechanics from the series including: 
* unit pathfinding, achieved using Dijkstra's algorithm to account for unit movement through terrain with varied move costs 
* sprite animations that make use of custom sprite classes to allow rendering of unit map and combat sprites and animations.  
* combat mechanics that use a probabalistic system to determine the outcomes of single combat events
* varied AI behavior amongst different enemy units to allow for dynamic and fun behavior.

Users will be able to control a cursor that they can move around during their turn to select their units, move them, and fight opposing units. The screen will include a button map to allow users to quickly infere the control scheme

# Wireframes (screenshot)

The app will include a single screen surronded by a button map on the left and right sides that communicates the controls to the user. The logo will be featured above the screen while links to my LinkedIn and GitHub accounts will be listed below the screen.
